Plans/to do:
============

- 1.8 support
- add screenshot using it to highlight a pipe system
- sound when finding something?  (only in auto-scan mode?)
- better sprites (help appreciated!)
- improvements for diamond dowsing rod
    - improved searching/filtering
        - whitelist, blacklist
        - use/ignore ore dictionary, metadata, NBT
        - multiple targets
    - upgrades
        - NEI handling for upgrade recipes
        - something in the recipe handler causing slowness when hovering over
          rod in inventory?
    - auto-scan mode
- sound stopped working when migrated to forge/ore-dowsing
