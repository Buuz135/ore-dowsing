Ore Dowsing - dowsing rods to help find ores and other blocks
=============================================================

This Minecraft mod provides items called Dowsing Rods which can help find ores
and other blocks. When you right-click with a Dowsing Rod it highlights ores
which it finds in a cube around you (sized from 9x9x9 to 17x17x17 depending
on the tier). Which ores it highlights is also dependent on the tier. See
[the wiki](https://github.com/rosche/ore-dowsing/wiki) for more details.
