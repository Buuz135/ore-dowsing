Plans/to do:
============

- better sprites (help appreciated!)
- give each block a reasonable (automatically determined) static color
  for its outline
    - investigate cofh.lib.util.getBlockTextureColor()
- improvements for diamond dowsing rod
    - improved searching/filtering
        - whitelist, blacklist
        - use/ignore ore dictionary, metadata, NBT
        - multiple targets
